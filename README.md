## Introduction
Hello my name is Nicolas Alvarez. I am 15 years old and im in 10th grade. I am a student at Chatsworth Charter High School. Some of my favorite movies are Godzilla Minus One and Rogue One, a star wars story. Some of my hobbies are playing and watching baseball, watching movies and shows, and one interesting thing about me is that I have always loved to build legos. I like getting new sets and also breaking them down to create new things. I am a huge fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers and my least favorite baseball team is either the Houston Astros, the San Franciso Giants, or the San Diego Padres, our biggest rivals. 

This summer I went to Seattle. It was a very nice trip. I saw the space needle and stayed in downtown Seattle. I went to the Pike Place Market and saw these huge waterfalls. Every time we went for a drive the mountains everywhere were big and covered with huge green trees. One thing that I really want to try is a program where I can learn to become a firefighter. It seems like a really cool job and when I get older I want to be able to help people, save lives, and be able to work with a team to get things done. 

This school year I really want to try and stop procrastinating so much. I used to leave everything for the last minute but this year im really going to try and be on top of all the work and attempt to finish them as quick as I get them. I also want to get the best grades that I can get in every class by putting in all my effort into my assignments. Hopefully 10th grade will be a good year.
